Based on [Ron Cobb's iconography work](http://typesetinthefuture.com/alien/) for _Alien_ (1979). The original source drawings are republished in his art book _Colorvision_ (1981). Vector adaptations are based on [Brandon Gamm's icons on The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/gamm/collection/semiotic-standard-icons-from-alien/), which are a pretty faithful recreation of the original, except for some clear differences, which I attempted to correct for in this set. Additionally they have been colorized and a white edge is provided (in accordance to Cobb's direction for when the icons are used against color backgrounds). Files are available in Affinity Design, SVG and PNG formats.
